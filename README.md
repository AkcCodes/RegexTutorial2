# RegexTutorial2
## Description

The purpose of this excercise was to create a gist file containing a tutorial on regex code. This tutorial will aid anyone who is looking to use regex as a way to implement string checks into their sites. In the gist, I will go over the different components of regex and also add a description of functionality for each component. Hopefully, this will aid users in identifying which components they may need to add to their own code.

## What I Learned?

This project helped me understand what a Regular Expression consists of and all of the usages for the different components of an expression. By writing down what it is that each component does, it effectively allows me to better identify situations of applicability in different coding contexts.
